##**Basic Breakdown of What's inside**##

- **Node.js** : The "engine" of the application. It's JavaScript on the server side and has an awesome package manager (npm). That's all I can say about it in a basic breakdown. You want something more in-depth go somewhere else.
- **Express.js** : A web application framework built for Node.js. It has everything implied with a web application framework (render files, what to do when someone hits you with a HTTP verb etc.).
-  **Socket.io** : A framework that deals with web sockets. What are web sockets? In simple terms it allows a client to maintain a persistent channel of communication with the server. Ideal for chat applications and probably this app. Can write a simple breakdown of how it work if requested.
-  **React** : A front-end framework that does really cool things. It acts as the view layer of an application and determines the state of components seen by the user and decides what needs to be rendered or updated. One of the ways React figures out what to change/update is through the use of a virtual DOM. It compares the state of the current DOM to that of the virtual one and looks for changes and reacts accordingly. Kind of like how those spot the difference games work. I don't know if any of that is actually how it works I'm just guessing. At the time of writing this I can't say too much else since I am still learning it. 
-   **Webpack** :


`cd` into the project directory.

run 

`npm install`

`nodemon server` 

head over to `localhost:3000` in your browser to check it out.
